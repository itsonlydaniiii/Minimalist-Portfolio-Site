        <br/><br/><br/><br/>
        <p id="intor"> I&apos;m Dani, a passionate and dedicated frontend developer with a background in 
            Tech Recruitment. My journey into coding began when I found myself fascinated by the work of 
            developers I encountered in my previous role. The creativity and problem-solving involved in 
            their work inspired me to dive into coding, initially as a hobby, but it quickly became a true passion.<br/><br/>

            I&apos;m well-versed in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a growing proficiency in Python. Currently, 
            I&apos;m expanding my skills in React and Angular, driven by a commitment to continuous learning and 
            improvement. Although I&apos;m still at the entry level in my coding career, I bring a strong mindset 
            of perseverance and a willingness to ask for help when needed. I believe that active listening and truly 
            understanding the needs of a project are key to delivering effective and user-friendly web designs.<br/> <br/>
            
            As I continue to develop my skills, I&apos;m excited about the opportunities ahead and look forward to 
            contributing to projects that challenge me and help me grow as a developer. My goal is to create engaging, 
            accessible, and visually appealing web experiences, and to keep evolving as a life-long learner in the 
            ever-changing world of web development.</p>
